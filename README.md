# FrontMenQuiz

We created the following assignment to test your Frontend skills/ knowledge. Please create a git repo (can
be local) before you start this assignment. 
When adding a commit please give a proper description to
explain your choices. 
It only has to run in chrome (so you should use es6). Please don't use any
boilerplates. You can/may use any framework/lib you want. When finished send a link or send your
folder(zip with .git folder).
As a client we want to have a Quiz that takes about 5 minutes to complete.
The user should start by entering his/her name (which is necessary to save the score at the end of the
game).
Every 30 seconds a random question will appear on the screen from the trivia api
(https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=1). It can never be the same question.
The answer should be chosen within the 30 seconds timeframe. If this is not the case the answer should be
saved as a not valid answer.
When the user answered 10 questions the application should show him the score and the standings which
will all be saved locally on the computer (no backend).
There should also be an Easter egg in the application. When someone types the word "RESET ALL" all
scores will be removed. Or come up with your own.
